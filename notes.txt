After some extensive research, I have come to the following conclusion:

use nginx (reverse proxy): for simple website visits, to reduce load capacity.
nginx is the thing preparing incoming requests. 
It is a layer on top of the current architecture. 

Then Gunicorn managing multiple Uvicorn workers. Each worker can serve multiple requests at the same time.
