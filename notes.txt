After some extensive research, I have come to the following conclusion:

- gunicron vs uWSGI: Doesn't matter that much for first time, use gunicorn,
it is easier to install.

- Nginx for the webserver. 

All of this inside a docker container.

What it is:
gunicorn/uwsgi: the thing executing the python code
nginx (reverse proxy): the thing preparing incoming requests
 for gunicorn/uwsgi

meinheld gunicorn docker and flask was the first try. It kind of worked. 


TODO:

- Integrate with flask
- implement timer functionality -> flask
- animate the arrows -flask coordinate

- move css to a real css file
-create more green colors, for example header
