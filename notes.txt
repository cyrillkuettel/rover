nginx is the thing preparing incoming requests. It is a layer on top of the current architecture. 
 


TODO:

- implement timer functionality -> take initial spark after the Websocket handshake (It is my impression that this is only the first time.)
- animate the arrows -> Take position from request
- vertical progress bar
